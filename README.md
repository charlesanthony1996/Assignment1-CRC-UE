### About the project

### Built without dotnet. Just two plain .cs files

### Get started


> Prerequisites\
1.install homebrew via 
                /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"\ \
                2.brew install mono


> Installation -> using mcs is also possible. csc is what i used (regarding the compiler) 

### Usage

### 1.Bubble sort algorithm

* main.cs -> bubble sort alogrithm

* how to run the program -> csc main.cs && mono main.exe

 - dotnet is not used to run the program
 
* Adjusting the program -> You have to change the array that needs to be sorted after the method to get it sorted for a different array of elements

* How the program works is mentioned in the comments of of the program itself.



### 2. Merge sort algorithm

* example2.cs -> mergesort algorithm

* How to run the program -> csc example2.cs && mono example2.exe

 - dotnet is not used to run the program. no dotnet commands.

* Adjusting the program -> You have to change the array that needs to be sorted after the method to get it sorted for a different array of elements

### Roadmap
### 1.Tasks to do for both

- [x] Basic implementation with comments

- [x] Markdown completion

- [ ] Time it function for each run

- [ ] Implementation in other languages eg:- python, c and c++

### 2. Table for execution times


| File  | Language | Time (seconds) |
| ------------- |            |       |
| main.cs      | c sharp     |       |   
| example2.cs  | c sharp     |       |
| bubblesort.py | python      |       |
|bubblesort.c | c |             |
|bubblesort.cpp | cpp |      |
| bubblesort.js| javascript| |
